# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m El Mehdi, a software engineer who enjoys diving into complex domains and solving unstructured problems. My experience is mostly in JavaScript, Ruby, Go, React, Express, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AWS, but Iâ€™m enthusiastic about learning any technologies or skills that will help the team succeed.

## Featured Project

Over the past couple of years, Iâ€™ve been learning software engineering at Launch School, gaining a solid foundation of fundamentals and the ability to analyze and articulate problems from a systems perspective. Most recently, I collaborated with a remote team to create [Canopy](https://canopy-framework.github.io), An open-source, low-config real-time monitoring framework designed specifically for CDNs.

Check out the [Case Study](https://canopy-framework.github.io/case-study) for more details!
